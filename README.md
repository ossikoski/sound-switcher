# Sound switcher Chrome plugin

Mute chrome tabs that are currently audible and unmute those that are currently muted.

#### Use case example:<br>
You are watching NFL on a Sunday night. You have the Rams - 49ers game on your main screen and the RedZone broadcast on your other screen, but muted. The Rams - 49ers game goes on a commercial break, so you'd want to mute that and unmute the RedZone broadcast.

## Key binds:
On default, the plugin is activated with the key combination Ctrl + Shift + End. This can be switched from chrome://extensions/shortcuts page. However, it is recommended to create a mouse macro for that key combination.
